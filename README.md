# Welcome

This project explores thoughts and ideas from today's Graph Data Modeling with Neo4j workshop.

## Getting started

Use [Neo4j AuraDB](https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/) to create a free instance.

Download your credentials and create a `.env` for reference. `.env.sample` has been provided to demonstrate what an example download of credentials from [Neo4j AuraDB](https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/) looks like.

## Graph Theory

## Introduction to Graph Data Modeling

## Introduction and Demo Graph Drawing with Arrows.app

### Exercise 1 - Explore Arrows.app

Watch the short ~3:31 video on YouTube at [Introduction and Demo Graph Drawing with Arrows.app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHJ-BrKJ8A4) and then create something.
